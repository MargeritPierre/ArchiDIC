# ArchiDIC: Two-scale Digital Image Correlation
*A suite of MATLAB scripts dedicated to the kinematical characterization of architectured structures*

### What do these scripts do ?
- `Meshing` the structure from a reference image
- Mesh-based `Global DIC` for the identification of *microscopic* kinematics
- Feature-based `Local DIC` for the quantification of *macroscopic* kinematics

### How to test the proposed procedures ?
1. `copy` the repository content in a folder
2. make this folder the MATLAB's `Current Folder`
3. run `main.m`
